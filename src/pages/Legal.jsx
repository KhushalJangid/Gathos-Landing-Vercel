      <h2>About Gathos</h2>

      <p><strong>Gathos</strong> is an API platform built for developers, creators, and AI agents. We provide two core APIs — <strong>Image Generation</strong> and <strong>TTS Voice Cloning</strong> — that can be plugged into any application, workflow, or AI agent with a single API key.</p>

      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>We believe AI-powered content generation should be accessible to every developer. Not locked behind complex SDKs, vendor lock-in, or opaque pricing. Gathos provides simple, transparent APIs that work everywhere — Claude Code, ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf, LangChain, or plain curl.</p>

      <h3>What We Offer</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Image Generation API</strong> — Generate images from text prompts. Supports multiple resolutions, prompt enhancement, and reproducible seeds.</li>
        <li><strong>TTS Voice Cloning API</strong> — Clone any voice with a reference audio sample, or use preset voices. Convert text to natural-sounding speech in seconds.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Agent Skills</h3>
      <p>Sign in to your dashboard to install our pre-built agent skills (Idea-to-Presentation, YouTube Video Factory, Script-to-Reel). Each skill is a prompt file scoped to your API key, ready to drop into Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or any shell-capable agent.</p>

      <h3>The Company</h3>
      <p>Gathos is a product of <strong>{COMPANY}</strong>, a software company registered in India focused on building AI-powered developer tools and creative platforms.</p>

    {
      q: 'What is Gathos?',
      a: 'Gathos is an API platform that provides Image Generation and TTS Voice Cloning APIs. You get API keys from our dashboard and use them in any application or AI agent.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How does the free trial work?',
      a: 'When you sign up, you get a 7-day trial with up to 20 generations per day (image + TTS combined), capped at 140 total over the week. Same 6-hour burst window and concurrency limit as the paid plan. You can create 1 image key and 1 TTS key during the trial. No credit card required.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How much does the Pro plan cost?',
      a: 'The Pro plan is $18/month with unlimited image generation and TTS voice cloning API calls. You can create multiple API keys per service.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What AI agents work with Gathos?',
      a: 'Any AI agent that can make HTTP requests. This includes Claude Code, ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, LangChain, CrewAI, OpenClaw, and any tool that can call APIs.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How does voice cloning work?',
      a: 'Send a reference audio file (5-30 seconds of clear speech) along with the text you want spoken. Our API clones the voice and generates speech in that voice. You can also use preset voices (koko, josh, pixxy, prof, rochie, spraky) without uploading audio.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What image formats and resolutions are supported?',
      a: 'Generated images are returned as base64-encoded PNG. Supported resolutions include 1024x1024, 1264x848, 848x1264, and more. Width and height must be divisible by 16.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Are my API keys secure?',
      a: 'Yes. We store API keys as SHA-256 hashes — the plaintext key is only shown once when created. Keys are validated on every request. You can revoke keys at any time from the dashboard.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What are the usage limits?',
      a: 'Pro users get unlimited daily generations with a 6-hour fair-use window of 75 calls (~12.5/hour sustained). The window cap exists to prevent runaway scripts from overloading shared GPU capacity, not to throttle real usage. Trial users get up to 20 calls/day combined (image + TTS) capped at 140 total across the 7-day trial. Limits reset automatically and an admin can adjust limits per user.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Can I cancel my subscription?',
      a: 'Yes, you can cancel anytime. You keep access until the end of your billing period. After that, your account reverts to the Free plan. See our Cancellation & Refund policy for details.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Do you offer refunds?',
      a: 'Yes, within 48 hours of purchase if you have used fewer than 5 generations. After 48 hours, no refund is available for the current billing cycle. See our Refund Policy for full details.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Is the source code open source?',
      a: 'The API platform is proprietary. Pre-built agent skills are available to subscribers from the dashboard and install into any shell-capable agent.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How do I get support?',
      a: `Email us at ${EMAIL}. We typically respond within 24 hours.`,
